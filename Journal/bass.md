The Golden Ratio is closely related to the Fibonacci Sequence perfectly symmetrical relationship between two proportions. Approximately equal to a 1:1.61 ratio, the Golden Ratio can be illustrated using a Golden Rectangle.

Plotting the relationships in scale provides us with what's known as a Golden Spiral. This occurs organically in the natural world.

### Visualizing the Golden Ratio in graphic design

When applied to design, the Golden Ratio simply provides us with a way of creating harmony and proportion. Our subconscious mind seems to be attracted to it.

The more you get used to the golden ratio, the more you’ll find the design hierarchy your design is asking for so that you could guide your viewer’s eye to a specific portion in your design. But sometimes you’ll find that the golden ratio doesn’t suit your design perfectly, while other times it does, and that’s fine. It is just another tool you can add to your designer’s toolkit but you can always break the rule.

### Typography

Typography is the easiest place to start implementing the golden ratio. For example, let’s say that you’re using 10pt font for the body text. Using the golden ratio, you can determine the best size for the headings by multiplying by 1.618. This not only makes the font size selection faster but also makes it eye candy.
10 × 1.618 = 16.18, which you can round down to 16pt font.

### Image composition

For image composition, the Golden Ratio is like a cheatsheet. It is always good to stop, take a step back and come back with a fresh eye while designing but if you don’t have the time for that, a quicker alternative is the Golden Ratio. Overlay the spiral, or grid, or the golden rectangle on your images to see which elements sit where and if they really do create harmony.
What the golden ratio does is signal you to focal areas where the user is likely to focus and look based on nature. It helps create balance and scale. The Golden Ratio can be applied to almost anywhere. Here is a website with the golden ratio template overlaid on them to see exactly how it relates to the individual designs.
A simple way to incorporate the golden ratio into a design is to crop photos (or any other images you may use) into a golden rectangle shape.
Applying the golden ratio to make an even proportional size difference between multiple elements—ignoring the harmony in image content:

### Logo Design

The logo is vital to a brand so people can understand your core message at almost a single glance. That’s why it’s a great idea to consider the Golden Ratio when designing a logo to instantly draw people in and help them connect.
Many of the biggest brands in the world use the Golden Ratio to form their logos: Pepsi, Natgeo, Apple and Twitter to name just a few.
