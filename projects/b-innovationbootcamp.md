**Anything and everything,** regardless of incomprehensibility!

We understand that if you incentivize dynamically, you may have to exploit wirelessly. We will disintermediate the power of returns-on-investment to monetize. Spriti introduced new capabilities represent a leap forward in the DXP space. We will enlarge our ability to whiteboard without lessening our power to benchmark. What do we harness?

<br>Water-logged tofu never gets super crispy. The key here is to slice the tofu into pieces before pressing it. Have you ever tried pressing a whole block, or even two halves? They just sit in soggy puddles. Slice them into smaller pieces to maximize the surface area. Press those, and you’ll extract more moisture—faster, too.

You might be wondering which starch is better. Cornstarch is a more processed ingredient, but it yields the crispiest results. Arrowroot is less processed and works well, but the outer covering can turn a little slippery and strange if you’re adding the tofu to a dish containing a lot of moisture (like curry).

Anywhoo, enough of this. Enjoy!
