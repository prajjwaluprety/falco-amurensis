**I smiled** not because it was a strange or a naive question.

I only smiled because I could remember my own past experiences flashing by like movie snapshots. How DID I end up here? All of a sudden, everything felt like a dream. But at the same time, I curled up my fingers to make a fist of victory. I did it, Iâ€™m finally here.

<br>Northern fur seals primarily inhabit two types of habitat: open ocean and rocky or sandy beaches on islands for resting, reproduction, and molting. 

Northern fur seals are a highly pelagic (live in the open ocean), are thought to be mostly solitary at sea, nocturnal species. They are known to be aggressive on land, especially during the breeding season. Adult males forcefully defend their breeding territory site. Male to male aggression is most frequently used in defense of territories and consists of pushing and biting, sometimes to the death. Female to female aggression is frequent but mild (open mouth threat). Intense female to female aggression (biting and pushing) is rare.   

And that's it, I guess.
